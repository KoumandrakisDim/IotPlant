
IoT Plant Monitoring

Overview

IoT Plant Monitoring is a web application designed to monitor and optimize the health of plants using soil moisture sensors and artificial intelligence (AI). The project integrates real-time data from soil moisture sensors and weather conditions to provide insights into the plant's water needs. The AI component predicts optimal watering schedules, minimizing water consumption while ensuring the well-being of the plants.

Features
Real-Time Data Display: View live soil moisture data from sensors in real-time through an intuitive web interface.

Smart Irrigation: Implement an AI-driven smart irrigation system that adapts watering schedules based on soil moisture levels, weather forecasts, and plant types.

Predictive Analytics: Leverage machine learning algorithms to predict when the plant's moisture level will fall below a specified threshold, helping users take proactive measures.

Weather Integration: Retrieve real-time weather data to enhance the accuracy of AI predictions and optimize watering decisions.

User-Friendly Interface: Access the application through a user-friendly web interface for easy monitoring and control.

Technologies Used
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Database: MongoDB
AI Framework: Brain.js
Weather API: Open-Meteo
